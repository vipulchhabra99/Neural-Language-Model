**Note**
- The training paramters of the model are quite large enough and hence they need some time to complete the processsing before futher processing.
- The files with perplexity scores with each sentence are generated automatically and also the avergae perplexity scores are reported.
- Once the model is trained and is fully ready to accept the user inputs for calculating perplexity scores. `Ready!` will be printed to inform the user for same.
- Untill the user passes `quit()` to the input the program will continue accepting the sentences as the input and will report it's perplexity scores.
